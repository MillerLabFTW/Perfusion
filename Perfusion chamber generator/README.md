## Perfusion chamber generator

This is the core OpenSCAD file for generating 3D printable perfusion chambers. Please see detailed instructions in our [Nature Protocols paper](https://rdcu.be/clcY7).

Note 1: Make sure you save the Tip.stl files in the same directory as the .scad file so that the boolean operations work in OpenSCAD!

Note 2: If the Luer tip sizes do not print correctly on your printer, look at the Luer Tip Calibration folder.
